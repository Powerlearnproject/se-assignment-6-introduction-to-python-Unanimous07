# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.


     => python is a programing languange that is powerful and versitile.
. 
          Readability:       Its syntax is clear and concise, resembling everyday English, making it easier to learn and write compared to other languages.
          Versatility:       Python can be used for various purposes, including web development, data science, scripting, machine learning, and scientific computing.
          Large Standard Library: Python comes with a rich collection of built-in modules and libraries that provide functionalities for common tasks, saving developers time from writing 
          code from scratch.

1. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
  
     => Download the Installer:

     Head to the official Python download page (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
        Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system and architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).


     Run the Installer:
        Double-click the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
        Important for Windows: During installation, ensure you check the option to "Add Python to PATH". This allows you to run Python commands from anywhere in your command prompt.


     Verify Installation (Command Line):
        Open a terminal or command prompt window.
        Type python --version (or python3 --version on some systems) and press Enter. If successful, you'll see the installed Python version.


setting the virtual environment
   Open a terminal or command prompt.
      
   Navigate to your project directory.
      
   Run the following command:
   python -m venv my_venv

   Activate the virtual environment:
     my_venv\Scripts\activate.bat
     
   (basically thats when you want to use it)

   Deactivate the environment when finished:
     deactivate
   
   (basically when you want to close the use of the environment.)

2. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
  
     => print("Hello world")
     basically the program make use of an inbult function called "print()" which is taking in a parameter

3. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
  
     =>
     Numeric Types:
      Integers (int): Represent whole numbers, positive, negative, or zero (e.g., 10, -5, 0).
     
      Floats (float): Represent decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -10.25).
     
     Complex Numbers (complex): Represent numbers with a real and imaginary part (e.g., 3+5j, where j represents the imaginary unit).
     
      Strings (str): Represent sequences of characters (text) enclosed in single quotes (''), double quotes (""), or triple quotes (''' or """) for multi-line strings.
     
      Booleans (bool): Represent logical values, True or False.
     
     Sequences:
      Lists (list): Ordered, mutable collections of elements enclosed in square brackets []. Elements can be of different data types. (e.g., [1, "hello", 3.4]).
     
      Tuples (tuple): Ordered, immutable collections of elements enclosed in parentheses (). Elements can be of different data types. (e.g., (10, "world", True)).
     
      Sets (set): Unordered collections of unique elements enclosed in curly braces {}. (e.g., {1, "apple", 1.5}).
     
      Dictionaries (dict): Unordered collections of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces {}. Keys must be unique and immutable, while values can be of any data type. (e.g., {"name":       "Alice", "age": 30}).


     the code sample.
     # Numeric Types
        age = 25          # Integer
        salary = 12345.67   # Float
        complex_num = 3+5j  # Complex Number
        
     # String
        name = "Bob"
        greeting = 'Hello, World!'  # Single quotes also work
        multiline_text = """This is a string
        spanning multiple lines."""
        
     # Boolean
        is_active = True
        is_admin = False
        
     # Sequences (List & Tuple)
        fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
        numbers = (1, 2, 3, 1)  # Duplicates are allowed in tuples
        
     # Sets
        unique_fruits = {"apple", "banana", "apple"}  # Duplicates are removed
        
        # Dictionary
        person = {"name": "Charlie", "age": 42, "hobbies": ["reading", "coding"]}
        
     # Printing the values
        print("Age:", age)
        print("Salary:", salary)
        print("Complex Number:", complex_num)
        print("Name:", name)
        print(greeting)
        print(multiline_text)
        print("Is Active:", is_active)
        print("Fruits:", fruits)
        print("Numbers:", numbers)
        print("Unique Fruits:", unique_fruits)
        print("Person:", person)

4. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
  
   Conditional statements and loops are fundamental building blocks in Python programming. They allow you to control the flow of your code based on certain conditions and repeat code 
    blocks multiple times.

   
   Conditional Statements (if-else):
   Used to make decisions based on whether a condition is True or False.
   The basic structure involves if, else, and optional elif statements.

      code example on the command. if statement. 
      age = 18
      
      if age >= 18:
          print("You are eligible to vote.")
      else:
          print("You are not eligible to vote.")

   Loops (for loop):
    Used to repeat a block of code a specific number of times or iterate through a sequence of elements.
    The basic structure involves for and an in keyword iterating over a sequence.

    code example on the command. The loop
   
     fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

      for fruit in fruits:
        print(fruit)

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
  
     =>
        Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They are essential for promoting code readability, modularity, and maintainability in your programs. 

     Here's is how import it is:
        Reusability: Once you define a function, you can call it multiple times throughout your code with different inputs. This saves you from writing the same code repeatedly.
     
        Modularity: Functions break down complex programs into smaller, manageable parts, making your code easier to understand and maintain.
     
        Readability: Functions with clear and descriptive names improve the overall readability of your code.


       Example for a function. 
       def add_numbers(x, y):
          """This function adds two numbers and returns the sum."""
          sum = x + y
          return sum
        
        # Example usage:
        result = add_numbers(5, 3)
        print("The sum of 5 and 3 is:", result)

     

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
  
     =>
     Lists:

       Ordered collection: Elements are arranged in a specific sequence, accessed by numerical indexes starting from 0.
       Mutable: Elements can be added, removed, or modified after creation.
       Duplicates allowed: Lists can contain duplicate elements.
       Heterogeneous: Lists can store elements of different data types.

     Dictionaries:
       
       Unordered collection: Elements are not stored in a specific order. Access is based on unique keys.
       Mutable: Key-value pairs can be added, removed, or modified after creation.
       Unique keys: Dictionary keys must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).
       Heterogeneous: Dictionaries can have keys of one data type and values of another (e.g., string keys with numerical values).


     # Create a list of numbers
       numbers = [1, 5, 3, 2, 5]
       
     # Accessing elements by index
       first_number = numbers[0]  # Accesses the first element (index 0)
       print("First number:", first_number)
       
     # Modifying elements
       numbers[2] = 7  # Changes the value at index 2 to 7
       print("Modified list:", numbers)
       
     # Check if an element exists (returns True/False)
       is_three_in_list = 3 in numbers
       print("Is 3 in the list:", is_three_in_list)
       
     # Looping through elements (using for loop)
       for number in numbers:
         print(number)
       
       
     # Create a dictionary with key-value pairs
       person = {
         "name": "Alice",
         "age": 30,
         "city": "New York"
       }
       
     # Accessing elements by key
       name = person["name"]  # Accesses the value for key "name"
       print("Name:", name)
       
     # Adding a new key-value pair
       person["occupation"] = "Software Engineer"
       print("Updated dictionary:", person)
       
     # Checking if a key exists (using `in`)
       is_age_key_present = "age" in person
       print("Is 'age' key present:", is_age_key_present)
       
     # Looping through key-value pairs (using for loop)
       for key, value in person.items():
         print(key, ":", value)

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
  
     =>

   try block: This block contains the code that might potentially raise an exception.
   
    except block(s): These blocks define how to handle specific exceptions that might be raised within the try block. You can have multiple except blocks to handle different exception 
    types.
   
    finally block (optional): This block contains code that will always be executed, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It's commonly used to clean up resources or 
    perform final actions.

code sample

   def divide(numerator, denominator):
     """This function divides two numbers and handles potential ZeroDivisionError."""
     try:
       result = numerator / denominator
     except ZeroDivisionError:
       print("Error: Cannot divide by zero.")
       result = None  # Or handle it differently (e.g., return a special value)
     finally:
       print("Division operation complete.")  # Always executes

   # Usage example
   try:
     division_result = divide(10, 2)
     print("Result:", division_result)

   division_by_zero = divide(10, 0)  # Will trigger ZeroDivisionError
   print("Result:", division_by_zero)
 except:  # This general except block will catch any unhandled exceptions
   print("An unexpected error occurred.")
    

10. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

     =>
     Modules:
       A single Python file (.py) containing functions, classes, and variables.
       Modules are used to group related functionalities together, promoting code organization and reusability.
       You can import modules into your scripts to access their functionalities.

     Packages:
       A collection of modules organized in a directory structure.
       The directory containing the __init__.py file (can be empty) is considered a package.
       Packages allow for hierarchical organization of modules, promoting larger-scale code management.


importing the whole module. 
     import math

# Access functions and constants from the math module
   result = math.sqrt(16)  # Using the math.sqrt() function
   print(result)


importing a specific variables/function 


   from math import pi, cos
   
   # Access specific functions/variables by name
   print("Pi value:", pi)
   angle = 45
   radian_angle = math.radians(angle)  # Using the imported cos function
   print("Cosine of 45 degrees:", math.cos(radian_angle))

11. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings 
      to a file.

      Here's how text file in Python are read:

        Open the file: Use the open function with the file path and mode ('r' for reading).
        
        Read the content:
        
        Use read() to read the entire file into a string.
        Use readline() to read a single line at a time.
        Use readlines() to read all lines of the file into a list.
        Close the file: Ensure you close the file using close() to release resources.



      example for reading a file.

        def read_file(filepath):
           """This function reads the contents of a text file and returns them as a string."""
           try:
             with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
               content = file.read()
               return content
           except FileNotFoundError:
             print("Error: File not found!")
             return None
         
       # Example usage
         file_path = "my_text_file.txt"
         file_content = read_file(file_path)
         
         if file_content:
           print("File Content:")
           print(file_content)
         else:
           print("Failed to read the file.")



      Here's how text file in Python are written:

        Open the file:
              Use the open function with the file path and mode ('w' for writing (overwrites existing content), 'a' for appending to existing content).
        
         Write the content:
             Use the write() method on the file object to write data (strings or string representations of other data types).
        
         Close the file:
            Remember to close the file using close() after writing.


      example of code to write in a text file,.

        def write_to_file(filepath, content_list):
           """This function writes a list of strings to a text file."""
           try:
             with open(filepath, 'w') as file:
               for line in content_list:
                 file.write(line + "\n")  # Add a newline character after each line
           except FileNotFoundError:
             print("Error: Could not create file!")
         
         # Example usage
         data_to_write = ["Line 1", "Line 2", "Line 3"]
         file_path = "my_data.txt"
         
         write_to_file(file_path, data_to_write)
  
         print("Successfully wrote data to the file.")
